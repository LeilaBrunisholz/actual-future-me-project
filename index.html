<h3>Education</h3>
<p>It is important to have experience and education in the field of film and movie making. One thing that would be very important to have is a bachelors degree in cinema studies. Multiple internships can also give one a start experience they need. Disney themselves provide internships for movies. While none of this is required to make a movie, in order to have a successful career, it is very important.

   <h3>Earning</h3>
   <li>For pay it depends how well your movie does. Directors get a percentage of what their movies make, so if a director's movie does really well, they will make a lot of money, however if the movie does poorly they will not make much profit at all. So, directors never really know how much money they are going to make until after their movie comes out since there is no set salary for them. </li>
  <li>Average salary is around $100,000</li>
    <li>The job is expected to grow 7%</li>

<h3>work enviornment</h3>
<li>Directors can work anywhere, especially with Disney since they have so many different stories. Usually directors are working in film studios indoors, but for movies like StarWars they filmed it outdoors. It is also a very good social environment because you are with the cast and crew all the time when filming, so everyone gets very close.
